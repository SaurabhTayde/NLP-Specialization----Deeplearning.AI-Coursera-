'NLP Specialization' program is offered by Deeplearning.AI on Coursera platform.
This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning - Younes Bensouda (Instructor of AI @Stanford) and Lukas Kaizer (Research Scientist at Google).
In this repository, I have added notes (by Deeplearning.AI), ungraded/graded assignments of all the four courses of this specialization.

The four courses in the program are:

1. Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
2. Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
3. Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
4. Natural Language Processing with Attention Models
